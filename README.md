## Site Deployment

To run a local server, you must first this command below in your terminal to receive all the node files

## Known Bugs

-  Currently the menu does interfere with the page when first loaded in but once clicking on the dropdown and click again to hide, the page will work normally. (This will effect the login page too by not letting you type in text box)

-   Big_image div wont resize to fit in page when resizes

-   menu.JS could have had a better js function to create the list in the menu drop down
